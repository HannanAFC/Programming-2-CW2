<p>You might have to select your Java SDK as well, this can be done by navigating to the settings menu in the top right -> Project Structure -> Project. Select the SDK dropdown and either select an existing one or select "Download JDK...", this automatically downloads one and selects it for you.</p>
<p>That's it, the project should be runnable now. You'll have to add the libraries below as well.</p>
